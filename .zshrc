# AI-powered Git Commit Function
# Copy paste this gist into your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc to gain the `gcm` command. It:
# 1) gets the current staged changed diff
# 2) sends them to an LLM to write the git commit message
# 3) allows you to easily accept, edit, regenerate, cancel
# But - just read and edit the code however you like
# the `llm` CLI util is awesome, can get it here: https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/

# Unalias gcm if it exists (to prevent conflicts)
unalias gcm 2>/dev/null

# Define the AI-powered gcm function using gemini
gcm() {
    # Function to generate commit message using the gemini model
    generate_commit_message() {
        git diff --cached | llm -m gemini-2.0-flash-lite "
You are an expert at writing Git commits. Your job is to write a short clear commit message that summarizes the changes.

If you can accurately express the change in just the subject line, don't include anything in the message body. Only use the body when it is providing *useful* information.

Don't repeat information from the subject line in the message body.

Only return the commit message in your response. Do not include any additional meta-commentary about the task.

Follow good Git style:

- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
- Try to limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with any punctuation
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Keep the body short and concise (omit it entirely if not useful)
